    %b Is there anything else like this?
    %br
    Absolutely. There are some smart folks who built a cool site called
    %a{:href=> "http://cufcq.com/"} cufcq.
    They have more data and time and people and money (I ain't got no money for a TLD) ....
    %br
    Honestly, had I known earlier, I would have chosen a different project.
